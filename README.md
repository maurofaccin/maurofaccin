## 🔎 I'm curious about complex systems

My main research interests include the analysis of **dynamic systems** that evolve and interact with **complex topologies or networks**.
This includes a wide range of interdisciplinary scenarios, from physics (my personal background) to medicine, from sociology to technology.
In particular, I focus on characterizing the **topological features** (such as communities or other mesoscopic structures) of the underlying data that emerge from the *analysis of the dynamics*.
I analyze those systems through the lenses of Information Theory, Statistical Physics and Quantum Mechanics.

I'm involved in:

- Estimating the Tuberculosis incidence rates in Sub-Saharan African regions (see [CartoTB](https://maurofaccin.github.io/cartotb))
- Writing a python package that compute the *best* partition of a network according to autoinformation maximization (see [AISA](https://maurofaccin.github.io/aisa)).
